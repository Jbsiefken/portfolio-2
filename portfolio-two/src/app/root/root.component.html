    <p class="section top-right">
        I am a web developer with a passion for finding creative solutions to problems. I graduated from the University of Iowa's Informatics program with high distinction.
        My skills include UI and UX design as well as back-end logic. To me, every project is an opportunity to learn something new and create something beautiful.
        I am currently based in Eastern Iowa, but I don't shy away from remote work. If you want to know more about what I can do for you, please don't hesitate to leave me a message
